# TODO

- [ ] Audit Logs: Implement a view to see `admin_attempts` and other audit trails directly in the dashboard.
- [ ] OIDC Core: Implement OpenID Connect authorization flows (client registration, discovery documents).
- [x] TLS: Support loading a single PEM bundle (Key + Cert + CA) to simplify Vault Agent integration and ensure atomic reloads.
